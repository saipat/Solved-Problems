// BST Sequences: A binary search tree was created by traversing through an array from left to right and inserting each element. Given a binary search tree with distinct elements, print all possible arrays that could have led to this tree.


// EXAMPLE
// Input: a tree with root 2 and nodes 3, 1
// Output: {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}
// E =>  tree with one node or no node
